1
00:00:07,533 --> 00:00:08,266
Welcome babies to my stream.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,133
Come on, wife

3
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:13,400
I'll always support you.

4
00:00:13,533 --> 00:00:14,133
Except for dancing

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,933
What else do you want to see?"

6
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:17,133
My wife looks great

7
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:18,266
I enjoy everything.

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,333
As long as you give me rockets

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,066
You can see anything

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,733
Love you, wife.

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,200
Lousy phone

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,400
Sweetie, wait for me, husband.

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,600
This bastard

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,133
Soul Culture: Bunny girl host is cute and sexy.

15
00:00:52,133 --> 00:00:52,666
Where is the anchor from?

16
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,200
Be your own sun: Thanks for your support.

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,333
Thanks for the gifts and support.

18
00:00:57,733 --> 00:00:58,266
Thanks all for the courtesy, husband.

19
00:00:58,733 --> 00:00:59,466
Xu Jie: Boring, let's talk privately!

20
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,600
Are you annoyed?

21
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,800
Who is that man, Jiang Qingqing?

22
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,666
What does it have to do with you?

23
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,333
Is Xu Jie's wealthy second gen?

24
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,133
Ah

25
00:01:08,133 --> 00:01:09,466
So what?

26
00:01:09,466 --> 00:01:11,733
Am I doomed to be poor with you forever?

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,133
Let's end it

28
00:01:14,133 --> 00:01:15,933
You can't give me the life I need.

29
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:20,466
Qingqing

30
00:01:20,466 --> 00:01:21,933
I was wrong, I was wrong

31
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:22,933
I shouldn't shout at you.

32
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:24,200
Will not lose your temper with you again

33
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,333
Can you forgive me?

34
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:27,200
Don't break up with me, Qingqing."

35
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,133
I don't care about you

36
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:29,400
Don't bother me in the future

37
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:39,933
Jiang Qingqing Xu Jie

38
00:01:41,066 --> 00:01:42,866
You dog man and woman

39
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:46,333
Go to death

40
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:50,466
Sorry, no line provided to shorten.

41
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,066
A good dog won't block the way.

42
00:02:01,066 --> 00:02:01,600
Move aside now

43
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,933
The young master finally found you

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,800
Sick

45
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,933
Who's your young boss?

46
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:06,933
Wrong person.

47
00:02:07,133 --> 00:02:07,933
I'm Hu Yun.

48
00:02:07,933 --> 00:02:09,200
Your father's personal butler

49
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,133
This time I came to you

50
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,200
My father

51
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:16,733
Since that was abandoned after my mother and son.

52
00:02:16,733 --> 00:02:18,733
I have no relation to him.

53
00:02:18,866 --> 00:02:20,200
Master left you long ago.

54
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,200
也有难处。

55
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,000
Who the hell has no hardships

56
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:28,800
Just because of that so-called hardship

57
00:02:29,266 --> 00:02:30,066
He left his wife and kids.

58
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:32,000
He has known for years

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,066
Me and my mother

60
00:02:33,066 --> 00:02:34,533
How did you get here?

61
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,200
The master will inherit the family.

62
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,933
It's their only option.

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Master's pocket money for you.

64
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,066
This card

65
00:03:01,066 --> 00:03:02,466
able to get you around the country

66
00:03:02,466 --> 00:03:04,133
All get best treatment

67
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:05,400
It shows status.

68
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,533
The master said

69
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:10,000
Before he completely inherited the first family

70
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:11,866
Please don't be public

71
00:03:14,533 --> 00:03:16,066
First family

72
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,466
That's it

73
00:03:17,466 --> 00:03:18,866
Control the world's economic core

74
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,000
Super big family

75
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:21,400
yes

76
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,733
Young master, trouble? Come to me.

77
00:03:24,933 --> 00:03:27,000
我们家族解决不了的困难没有

78
00:03:42,733 --> 00:03:43,533
Son

79
00:03:47,466 --> 00:03:48,533
To give

80
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:49,733
This month's living costs

81
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:50,600
Take it

82
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:53,733
Six hundred seems a bit low

83
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:02,066
Mom can still earn more

84
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,000
You're at school.

85
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,333
Just eat and drink

86
00:04:04,466 --> 00:04:05,133
Auntie

87
00:04:05,133 --> 00:04:06,133
Rovita is at school.

88
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:07,000
Food and drink are good.

89
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,666
And not only that

90
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:09,400
He still has money to tip girls.

91
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,533
I don’t get some people

92
00:04:11,066 --> 00:04:11,600
What kind of big-tailed wolf is pretending to be here

93
00:04:11,866 --> 00:04:12,533
No young master's life.

94
00:04:12,533 --> 00:04:13,466
He also got the young master's disease

95
00:04:13,466 --> 00:04:14,400
It's really shameless

96
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,666
Don't listen to her

97
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:18,733
I have money now

98
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:20,400
I'll take you shopping for a few clothes.

99
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,866
Pick what you want; I'll buy it for you.

100
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,266
What are you talking about?

101
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,066
Casual clothes here

102
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:28,533
No two or three hundred

103
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,333
We are a high-end brand

104
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,866
Clothes don’t cost over two or three hundred.

105
00:04:32,466 --> 00:04:33,533
What do you mean?

106
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,933
It means that you pee

107
00:04:34,933 --> 00:04:35,866
Take care of yourself

108
00:04:35,933 --> 00:04:36,933
Not just anyone

109
00:04:36,933 --> 00:04:38,266
You can come to our store to consume

110
00:04:39,466 --> 00:04:40,400
Let's go now

111
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:40,933
Let's go

112
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:43,066
Today, I'll see it.

113
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:44,000
What's in the store?

114
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,666
I can't afford it

115
00:04:45,266 --> 00:04:46,733
I really look down on you.

116
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:47,733
Obviously a poor student

117
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:48,400
Okay, don't learn

118
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,133
I only want to learn dressing.

119
00:04:49,266 --> 00:04:50,266
Are you eligible?

120
00:04:50,266 --> 00:04:51,333
You repeat

121
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:52,666
Too lazy to deal with you.

122
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:53,200
Get out of here

123
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,333
Leave now or I'll call security.

124
00:04:54,533 --> 00:04:55,133
What's going on

125
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:55,933
What are you arguing about?

126
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,733
This person insisted on coming to the store to make trouble

127
00:04:57,733 --> 00:04:59,133
was about to blast him out

128
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:02,533
Whose card is this?

129
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:03,600
Any questions

130
00:05:03,733 --> 00:05:04,400
Sir

131
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,200
Is this your card?

132
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,266
Well

133
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:08,800
Meet the heir of the first family

134
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:15,866
Meet the first family heir

135
00:05:16,266 --> 00:05:17,133
This is not just one

136
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:18,266
Regular bank card

137
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,333
Shut up

138
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,733
Your performance this month is gone

139
00:05:20,733 --> 00:05:22,333
Make tea for them now.

140
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,133
You know me

141
00:05:25,866 --> 00:05:27,133
No资格。

142
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,666
I'm abroad

143
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:29,533
I have met the chairman

144
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:31,333
Very respectful to an old man

145
00:05:31,533 --> 00:05:32,200
He is in his hands

146
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:32,933
There is one

147
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,200
Cards that are exactly like you

148
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,800
Didn't expect this card

149
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,866
It surprisingly has big deterrence.

150
00:05:38,866 --> 00:05:41,066
My dad's family seems strong.

151
00:05:41,066 --> 00:05:45,466
No

152
00:05:45,466 --> 00:05:46,533
You are in the store today

153
00:05:46,533 --> 00:05:47,266
All spending

154
00:05:47,266 --> 00:05:48,266
I'll pay for it

155
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:49,133
Just be

156
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:50,200
Sorry for the trouble.

157
00:05:51,533 --> 00:05:53,733
Not welcome here

158
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:54,333
Don't stay

159
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,733
How dare a small shop not welcome you

160
00:05:56,866 --> 00:05:57,933
Even our whole group

161
00:05:57,933 --> 00:05:59,066
I don't dare to go against you

162
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,733
This is our group's gold card

163
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,333
With this card

164
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,600
Under our group

165
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,666
Any mall

166
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:06,400
All are free

167
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,066
Please also ask your lord not to remember the villain's faults

168
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:08,800
Yes

169
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,000
I'll take your apology.

170
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,333
Don't forget to come to KTV to work at night

171
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,333
I've promised your goddess.

172
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,533
Make me happy.

173
00:06:22,533 --> 00:06:24,466
I'll get her to top rank.

174
00:06:24,466 --> 00:06:27,666
Ah

175
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:28,600
Your goddess

176
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,266
How is it in front of me

177
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:31,666
Please, please

178
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:32,800
Hahahahaha

179
00:06:33,133 --> 00:06:34,866
行啊，徐大少

180
00:06:34,866 --> 00:06:36,600
I'll watch your show.

181
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:41,666
Wife

182
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:42,400
Drink tea

183
00:06:42,866 --> 00:06:44,266
Who is your wife?

184
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,666
Didn't I say it?

185
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:47,666
If you help me rush to the top of the list

186
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,200
I'll consider being your girlfriend again

187
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,266
Qingqing

188
00:06:50,266 --> 00:06:51,666
Wait two more days for me.

189
00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:53,133
In two days, I’ll get my pay.

190
00:06:53,133 --> 00:06:54,333
I'll help you make the list right away, okay?"

191
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,400
etc

192
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,933
I don't have time to wait for you.

193
00:06:58,466 --> 00:06:59,533
You waste

194
00:06:59,533 --> 00:07:00,800
I can't count on it

195
00:07:01,133 --> 00:07:01,866
Qingqing

196
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,800
Jiang Qingqing

197
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,666
Don't look down on young and poor.

198
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,066
I'm here

199
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,066
、

200
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:28,333
Yo is still Brother Xu's atmosphere

201
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,866
Sister-in-law's list is stable

202
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:32,800
As expected of Xu family's eldest.

203
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,200
The shot is so generous

204
00:07:37,266 --> 00:07:38,133
How can it be

205
00:07:38,133 --> 00:07:39,066
How am I now?

206
00:07:39,066 --> 00:07:40,200
It's eleventh on the list

207
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,733
Brother Xu, you have to help me

208
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,600
Don't worry, I'll give you another one.

209
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,400
Yo-yo-yo不好

210
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,466
My sister-in-law was squeezed out of the top ten of the list again

211
00:07:49,933 --> 00:07:50,666
What

212
00:07:51,066 --> 00:07:51,866
Brother Xu

213
00:07:51,866 --> 00:07:53,200
You can help me

214
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,066
If you put me in the top ten

215
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,600
I can do whatever you say

216
00:07:58,266 --> 00:07:59,600
The top ten live broadcast room rewards

217
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,133
Each one is more than one hundred thousand

218
00:08:02,466 --> 00:08:03,800
This week's list is forgotten

219
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,600
Go back and rest first

220
00:08:05,533 --> 00:08:06,466
All right

221
00:08:06,866 --> 00:08:08,466
That person will go back and wait for you

222
00:08:08,733 --> 00:08:10,000
You must come

223
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:10,933
Just go

224
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:21,933
Who else do I think?

225
00:08:22,266 --> 00:08:24,000
Isn't this the dog licking Luo Wei?

226
00:08:24,466 --> 00:08:25,000
Come on

227
00:08:25,466 --> 00:08:26,600
Take the money your master gave you

228
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,066
Get out of here

229
00:08:29,866 --> 00:08:30,400
Don't roll yet

230
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,666
Give you ten minutes

231
00:08:38,133 --> 00:08:39,200
Get out

232
00:08:39,466 --> 00:08:40,400
Oops

233
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,600
You poor ghost asked me to get out

234
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:44,866
Tell you

235
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:46,800
Lao Tzu is a super VIP here

236
00:08:47,066 --> 00:08:49,000
Super VIP right?

237
00:08:49,266 --> 00:08:50,866
I have to show you today

238
00:08:50,866 --> 00:08:52,933
What is a real super VIP

239
00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:55,400
Pass it on

240
00:08:55,466 --> 00:08:56,733
All consumption today

241
00:08:56,733 --> 00:08:58,066
I will pay for it

242
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,266
All the wine is casual

243
00:09:00,266 --> 00:09:01,000
But

244
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,000
Some dogs are never allowed inside

245
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:09,600
Pass it on

246
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,066
All consumption today

247
00:09:11,066 --> 00:09:12,133
I will pay for it

248
00:09:12,133 --> 00:09:14,200
All the wine is casual

249
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:14,933
But

250
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,533
Such a high-end occasion

251
00:09:16,733 --> 00:09:18,400
I always feel like some dogs

252
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,800
It's an eyesore here

253
00:09:20,866 --> 00:09:21,733
The accounts have been cleared

254
00:09:21,733 --> 00:09:23,000
Young Master Luo Wei paid 500,000 yuan

255
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Blast him out for me

256
00:09:25,133 --> 00:09:25,733
Get out

257
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,666
How can it be

258
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,066
Where did you get the money?

259
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,200
Don't think that a few stinky money is amazing

260
00:09:31,266 --> 00:09:32,466
I'm sorry

261
00:09:32,466 --> 00:09:34,866
I just think I'm amazing

262
00:09:35,066 --> 00:09:36,600
You think that's it

263
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:37,733
You owe me

264
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,533
It's just the beginning

265
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,933
I'm telling you

266
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,666
I'm not short of money

267
00:09:43,133 --> 00:09:45,000
I am not welcome here

268
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,133
I'm not uncommon

269
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:47,333
Let's go

270
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,333
Slow down

271
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,333
What do you want to do

272
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,666
If I remember correctly

273
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,733
Master Xu hasn't paid the bill yet

274
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,733
You spend a total of 3,870 yuan

275
00:09:54,933 --> 00:09:56,733
Isn't it just 3,000 yuan?

276
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,200
What I have is money

277
00:10:03,466 --> 00:10:04,200
Is there any money?

278
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,200
Don't be here if you don't have money

279
00:10:06,133 --> 00:10:06,933
How can it be

280
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,733
I was still there just now

281
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:08,666
The live broadcast room swiped 30,000 yuan

282
00:10:09,733 --> 00:10:10,533
Hey Dad

283
00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:12,400
Why is there no money in my bank card?

284
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,666
Don't talk to me

285
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,000
The patrol knocks on the door outside

286
00:10:15,133 --> 00:10:15,800
What's wrong, Dad

287
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
You cheating thing

288
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:17,466
It's out there

289
00:10:17,466 --> 00:10:18,333
What kind of person did you offend

290
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,800
Your father is going to be killed by you."

291
00:10:19,866 --> 00:10:21,866
Comrade police officer

292
00:10:22,533 --> 00:10:23,866
Master Xu, I still have some money

293
00:10:23,866 --> 00:10:24,933
Let's get out quickly

294
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,333
Hey

295
00:10:27,533 --> 00:10:28,600
What do you want to do?

296
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,533
Master Xu

297
00:10:29,533 --> 00:10:31,266
Just broke my bottle of wine

298
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,733
I haven't given the money yet."

299
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,333
Isn't it just a bottle of wine?

300
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,266
How much can it be worth?

301
00:10:35,266 --> 00:10:35,933
I will pay you

302
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,866
Well, it's really refreshing

303
00:10:38,066 --> 00:10:40,133
The Macallan '82 Collector's Edition

304
00:10:40,133 --> 00:10:42,000
88888

305
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,666
Pay

306
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,866
What

307
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:55,533
It seems that our eldest young master Xu

308
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:57,066
No money to settle the bill

309
00:11:00,866 --> 00:11:01,933
Let him be obedient

310
00:11:02,466 --> 00:11:03,800
What do you TM want to do?

311
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:04,466
You dare to touch me

312
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:06,066
The Xu family will not let you go

313
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,333
Are you still young?

314
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,733
It can be here

315
00:11:13,733 --> 00:11:15,266
Work slowly to pay off debts

316
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,866
You wait for me

317
00:11:17,866 --> 00:11:20,066
How can you make me wait."

318
00:11:20,533 --> 00:11:23,800
Master Xu doesn't know yet

319
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,133
made a phone call

320
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,866
Your father now

321
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,866
It has been because of illegal fundraising

322
00:11:28,866 --> 00:11:30,133
was arrested

323
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,666
Face him

324
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,200
It will be an endless prison disaster

325
00:11:34,466 --> 00:11:35,866
There is no family

326
00:11:38,066 --> 00:11:40,133
You talk nonsense, you talk nonsense

327
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,066
On one's mind

328
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,133
This is your life

329
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:52,600
The best red wine ever drunk

330
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:53,466
Take away

331
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:54,666
bastard

332
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,933
Where is Brother Xu

333
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,333
Luo Wei

334
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,600
How can you drink here at night

335
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,866
Can you be a little more mature?

336
00:12:06,133 --> 00:12:08,733
It turned out that I thought you loved me so much

337
00:12:08,733 --> 00:12:10,800
Willing to work here to support me

338
00:12:10,866 --> 00:12:12,866
It turns out you're just messing around here

339
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,600
What happened to me with my own money

340
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,466
It's better than that Xu Jie

341
00:12:15,466 --> 00:12:16,800
Use his old money to be strong

342
00:12:16,866 --> 00:12:17,800
Is it

343
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,133
You use your own money

344
00:12:19,133 --> 00:12:21,000
I didn't dare to admit it if I stole money

345
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,266
Your mother should be ashamed of you

346
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,733
What do you mean

347
00:12:24,866 --> 00:12:25,533
Luo Wei

348
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:26,800
You are really thick-skinned

349
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,133
I was really blind

350
00:12:28,133 --> 00:12:29,466
You stole Zhao Huan's money

351
00:12:29,466 --> 00:12:31,066
Forget about buying clothes for your mother

352
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:33,000
You're still drinking here

353
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,266
Zhao Huan's family is rich

354
00:12:35,466 --> 00:12:37,400
But she is not obliged to come to your rescue

355
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,533
You know

356
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,133
Hey

357
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:46,933
You thief

358
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,866
How dare you steal this girl's money

359
00:12:48,866 --> 00:12:50,466
No wonder Qingqing dumped you

360
00:12:50,466 --> 00:12:51,333
People like you

361
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:52,600
Not worthy of a girlfriend at all

362
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,200
Who stole your money

363
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,466
You explain the words to me clearly

364
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,533
Who stole your money

365
00:12:59,533 --> 00:13:00,866
You explain the words to me clearly

366
00:13:00,933 --> 00:13:06,200
I don't bother to tell you

367
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,600
You're still fooling around outside

368
00:13:08,066 --> 00:13:09,266
I'm really sorry, classmate

369
00:13:09,266 --> 00:13:10,466
But I believe in my son

370
00:13:10,466 --> 00:13:11,400
He didn't mean to

371
00:13:11,466 --> 00:13:12,666
Okay, okay, don't say it

372
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:13,600
Take care of your son

373
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,333
It's very annoying

374
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,466
I didn't steal money

375
00:13:15,466 --> 00:13:16,733
stole money to buy clothes for your mother

376
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:17,333
I still don't admit my mistake

377
00:13:17,733 --> 00:13:18,666
You say a few words

378
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:19,533
I'll settle the score for you when I go back

379
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,333
Mom, believe me, I didn't steal money

380
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,400
actually stole money to buy clothes for his mother

381
00:13:23,533 --> 00:13:24,600
This poor filial piety

382
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,266
I ask you how much you have lost

383
00:13:26,466 --> 00:13:27,733
What's wrong with two thousand?

384
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,000
If I tell you

385
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,733
My mother's dress

386
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:31,266
More than two thousand dollars

387
00:13:31,266 --> 00:13:32,666
Can you prove that I didn't take it?

388
00:13:33,066 --> 00:13:34,400
What the hell are you trying to say?

389
00:13:34,466 --> 00:13:35,866
Just like you

390
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:37,600
Thousands of dollars of clothes

391
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,000
I want to say that

392
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,133
You can't afford this dress for my mother

393
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:42,133
You don't have that much money STANDING either

394
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:43,533
What do you pretend?

395
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:44,333
Your mother's dress

396
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:45,133
If I can't afford it

397
00:13:45,133 --> 00:13:46,266
I'll give you back the two thousand dollars

398
00:13:46,266 --> 00:13:47,266
I slapped myself again

399
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,133
Okay

400
00:13:48,533 --> 00:13:49,200
See for yourself

401
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:53,266
What do you see?"

402
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:54,333
Don't be afraid that we will support you

403
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,666
Luo Wei didn't steal my money

404
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,000
I made a mistake myself

405
00:14:01,533 --> 00:14:03,066
Oh Mom, where did you get so much money?

406
00:14:03,066 --> 00:14:03,733
DC
 You sold blood

407
00:14:04,066 --> 00:14:06,466
There is no time for me to draw blood

408
00:14:06,466 --> 00:14:07,666
Come on a beautiful little girl

409
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,066
said it was your classmate

410
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:10,400
Lend me two thousand yuan

411
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,466
Hey you boy

412
00:14:12,466 --> 00:14:13,866
Is it secretly in love?

413
00:14:14,266 --> 00:14:15,266
No, no

414
00:14:15,266 --> 00:14:16,000
OUSTANDING
 What does that person look like?

415
00:14:16,466 --> 00:14:18,400
He is beautiful and watery

416
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,733
Oh, the figure is good

417
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,600
There is about 1.7 meters

418
00:14:20,866 --> 00:14:22,266
When I saw her

419
00:14:22,266 --> 00:14:23,866
Wearing a pair of sports leggings

420
00:14:23,866 --> 00:14:25,533
Anyway, you kid is blessed

421
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:26,800
1.7 meters

422
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,800
Sports Leggings:

423
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,266
Then it can only be her

424
00:14:32,066 --> 00:14:33,000
Hey Yang Huan

425
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:33,800
Wait a minute

426
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,000
Luo Wei

427
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,466
Oh my mother's business

428
00:14:37,533 --> 00:14:38,866
Thank you for that

429
00:14:38,866 --> 00:14:40,200
Why don't I treat you to dinner."

430
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,000
No

431
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,933
Oh, you can choose the location

432
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,466
You really want to thank me

433
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:45,600
Then let's eat the cafeteria

434
00:14:46,533 --> 00:14:47,800
Canteen hey

435
00:14:48,133 --> 00:14:49,000
You stinky dick

436
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,866
It is also worthy of inviting Huanhuan to dinner

437
00:14:49,866 --> 00:14:51,066
Others invite girls to dinner

438
00:14:51,066 --> 00:14:52,333
That's all in fine dining restaurants

439
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:53,666
You are in the cafeteria

440
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:54,933
Are you a man?

441
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,333
I eat in the cafeteria, and I am happy

442
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:57,200
What does it matter to you

443
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,600
I invite you to the evening

444
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Kebin International

445
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,400
Whatever you want to eat

446
00:15:02,133 --> 00:15:03,600
Do you want to be with me?

447
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,333
My young master can pity you."

448
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:06,600
Take you to see the world

449
00:15:06,733 --> 00:15:08,066
So that you know

450
00:15:08,066 --> 00:15:09,066
between you and us

451
00:15:09,066 --> 00:15:10,200
How big is the gap?

452
00:15:10,866 --> 00:15:12,333
Kaibin International is, right?

453
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,933
Oh, it's the evening rush hour now

454
00:15:18,933 --> 00:15:20,466
Why hasn't this Luo Wei come yet?

455
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,200
If you take a taxi, it will be blocked

456
00:15:22,733 --> 00:15:23,800
Luo Wei here

457
00:15:24,533 --> 00:15:25,933
Sorry for the traffic jam

458
00:15:25,933 --> 00:15:26,533
It's late

459
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:28,933
Yo brothers

460
00:15:29,066 --> 00:15:30,066
It costs a lot of money

461
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,733
Okay, you can say a few words

462
00:15:31,866 --> 00:15:32,600
Where did you get in?

463
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:33,533
You can enter through the main entrance

464
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:34,600
Hello

465
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,866
Please show your reservation information

Sorry sir

468
00:15:37,866 --> 00:15:39,266
We at Kaibin International are members-based

469
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,466
Isn't it just a member?

470
00:15:40,533 --> 00:15:41,800
I'll just give you the money

471
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,333
Non-members need to book one year in advance

472
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,133
Hey, I have to go in today

473
00:15:45,133 --> 00:15:46,200
The annual consumption reaches 10 million

474
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,800
to join

475
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,800
You can't enter Mr

476
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,800
I really want to pretend not to know him

477
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,600
Why don't I change places?"

478
00:15:55,066 --> 00:15:56,466
Now we can go inside

479
00:15:56,466 --> 00:15:57,200

Quality

482
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,666
I want you to pretend to be my boyfriend

483
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,666
I know it's embarrassing for you

484
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:06,866
You have to feel that the money is small

485
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:07,866
You say the number

486
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:09,000
E SES

487
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,333

488
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,933
Forget the money

489
00:16:12,866 --> 00:16:13,800
The address is sent to me

00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,666
I'll go tomorrow
 ES

491
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,133
Young master

492
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,266
The gift you ordered is ready

493
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,266
I asked you to prepare one for me

494
00:16:29,266 --> 00:16:31,133
A low-key gift with connotation

495
00:16:31,133 --> 00:16:32,533
You prepared this for me

496
00:16:35,466 --> 00:16:38,133
Enough to explode

497
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,066
It's so early

498
00:16:42,066 --> 00:16:42,933
Beautiful women make an appointment

499
00:16:42,933 --> 00:16:44,000
Of course, come early

500
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:46,133
Come in

501
00:16:49,733 --> 00:16:50,666
This is the living room

502
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,533
Over there is a study and fitness room

503
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:53,733
Usually Su Li and me

504
00:16:54,133 --> 00:16:55,600
Worked out in the gym together

505
00:16:56,466 --> 00:16:58,733
Will Su Li come again in a while?

506
00:17:00,933 --> 00:17:01,733
will come

507
00:17:02,533 --> 00:17:03,400
I asked her to come later

508
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:03,933
Just let her

509
00:17:03,933 --> 00:17:05,200
Help me prepare something

510
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:06,600
Ten

511
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:08,800
Oh, let's go, let's go

512
00:17:09,933 --> 00:17:11,133
What are you going to do?

513
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,666
You promised me

514
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,666
Protect me throughout the process today

515
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,866
I'll do what you say

516
00:17:28,466 --> 00:17:30,333
Luo Wei: Can you be lighter?

517
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:33,600
I would like to listen to your arrangements

518
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,866
No one dares to ask me to apologize yet

519
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,333
THE

520
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:41,266
Luo Wei was careful

521
00:17:42,533 --> 00:17:43,400
ss you

522
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:49,733
You let go of me

523
00:17:49,866 --> 00:17:50,866
Help me

524
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,533
Where is the miss?

525
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:56,066
The young lady changed her dress in the room

526
00:17:59,466 --> 00:18:00,266
Rovi Lowe

527
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,733
Can you lighten it?

528
00:18:01,733 --> 00:18:02,333
Excuse me

529
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:03,933
This is the first time I have encountered this kind of thing

530
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,333
You lighten it, you hurt me."

531
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,400
Oh, I'm sorry

532
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,400
It's almost good, it's almost good

533
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,533
Yang Huan, what are you doing inside

534
00:18:13,533 --> 00:18:14,466
Tang... Tang Shao

535
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,400
Who did you put in?"

536
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,000
It's all in Yang Huan's bedroom

537
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,133
What are you shouting?

538
00:18:27,933 --> 00:18:29,266
What are you doing?

539
00:18:29,466 --> 00:18:31,733
I just let Rovi
 Zip it up for me

540
00:18:31,733 --> 00:18:33,133
Are you okay?"

541
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:35,533
He's my boyfriend

542
00:18:35,533 --> 00:18:37,666
We've been together for a month

543
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,466
I will never marry you

544
00:18:42,133 --> 00:18:44,000
The woman who dares to mess with me Tang Shao

545
00:18:44,266 --> 00:18:45,733
You wait for me

This gift is too expensive

558
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,800
I can't take it

559
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,933
No matter how precious it is, it is not as precious as yours

560
00:19:12,933 --> 00:19:13,733
Wow

00:19:16,266 --> 00:19:17,733
Only one colored diamond can appear

563

This is particularly precious

564
00:19:19,266 --> 00:19:21,266
Young Master Tang is really generous

565
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,466

00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:48,933
This is me

577
00:19:48,933 --> 00:19:50,466
A birthday gift for Miss Yang

578
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:52,533
Just this broken box

579
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:55,000
Give me the colored diamonds I gave to Yang Huan

580
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,333
Is it still a valuable gift?

581
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,133
Hahahaha

582
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,533
Isn't this just a broken stone?

583
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,600
You gave it to me

584
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,066
Not as good as an apple

585
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,600
You see clearly

586
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,533
Wei

587
00:20:12,066 --> 00:20:13,933
It can be more expensive than diamonds

588
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:18,066
I said don't believe Luo Wei

589
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,933
Yang Huan, you are really too

590
00:20:20,066 --> 00:20:22,200
Find someone to pretend to be a boyfriend

591
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,733
Don't look for a rich one

592
00:20:23,933 --> 00:20:24,933
Don't get out of here

593
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,333
Yang Huan trusts you so much

594
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:27,533
What did you give away?"

595
00:20:27,533 --> 00:20:29,933
Yes, get out of here

596
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,666
How about Miss Yang

597
00:20:35,733 --> 00:20:37,000
Now you know

598
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,133
With me

599
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:40,266
It's the best choice

600
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,400
Miss

601
00:20:44,533 --> 00:20:45,933
Rowe asked me to leave this to you

602
00:20:47,933 --> 00:20:49,533
Luo Wei didn't ask for money

603
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:53,666
What is Huanhuan looking at?

604
00:20:53,733 --> 00:20:54,600
Miss

605
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,733
Sister is back

606
00:20:56,866 --> 00:20:59,333
It's nothing more than a stone

607
00:21:00,866 --> 00:21:01,800
This is

608
00:21:01,866 --> 00:21:03,133
My sister knows this thing

609
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:04,800
This thing has a price and no market

610
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,266
It is the most expensive metal in the world

611
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,466
It is extremely helpful in treating cancer

612
00:21:10,466 --> 00:21:11,466
It is in the world now

613
00:21:11,466 --> 00:21:12,666
Treat cancer is one of the few

614
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:13,466
Advanced means

615
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:16,133
The annual output is only 0. 25 g

616
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,200
1 gram costs at least 3, 0 million

617
00:21:20,466 --> 00:21:22,000
No wonder when Luo Wei sent me

618
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,466
Say wish me good health

619
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:26,533
Oh no, I misunderstood him

620
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,466
What is Luo Wei?

621
00:21:31,733 --> 00:21:33,333
Just a poor DS

622
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,466
Dare to oppose me

623
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:35,866
You are not participating

624
00:21:35,866 --> 00:21:37,666
Miss Yang's birthday party?

625
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,000
Why are you so angry

626
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,533
Go

627
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:41,933
Bring my notebook

628
00:21:46,066 --> 00:21:47,533
I didn't expect this thing

629
00:21:47,533 --> 00:21:53,466
It's really invincible

630
00:21:53,466 --> 00:21:55,600
ThinkPad

631
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,933
Although I don't know

632
00:21:56,933 --> 00:21:58,466
How did you get it?

633
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,666
You're screwed

634
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:04,133
Play tricks with me

635
00:22:05,266 --> 00:22:05,800
You don't deserve it

636
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:06,866
You mean

637
00:22:07,066 --> 00:22:09,800
Doesn't Yang Huan like you quite a bit?"

638
00:22:11,733 --> 00:22:14,000
I made her hate you for the rest of my life

639
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,733
Young master, your trick

640
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,933
2020

Long wait

651
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,533
I misunderstood you today

652
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,666
I'm sorry, Luo Wei

653
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:56,200
E SES didn't eat at the party either

654
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,866
Otherwise, treat me to a late-night snack

PtE SES I will forgive you

Respect you

658
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:04,000
For today's events

659
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:05,200
I apologize to you

660
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,600
Luo Wei

661
00:23:09,733 --> 00:23:10,533
Thank you

662
00:23:10,733 --> 00:23:12,200
What are you polite to me?"

663
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,200
Didn't you help me once

664
00:23:15,733 --> 00:23:16,533
Hey

665
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:19,133
Yang Huan

666
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,200
Oops

667
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,200
Haha laughed to death

668
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,733
I don't know how to hide

669
00:23:28,733 --> 00:23:29,600
You okay

670
00:23:31,733 --> 00:23:32,533
Zhao Huan

671
00:23:32,733 --> 00:23:33,400
You did it on purpose

672
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,000
Are you addicted to bullying?

673
00:23:35,066 --> 00:23:35,933
Thank you

674
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,600
I'm fine

675
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,733
What does it have to do with me

676
00:23:37,733 --> 00:23:38,666
It was she who was careless

677
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:39,400
Walk without looking at the road

678
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,333
How can you blame me

679
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:41,200
What nonsense

680
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,866
I clearly saw that it was you

681
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:45,000
Apologize

682
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:45,933
What do you call your dog?

683
00:23:45,933 --> 00:23:47,266
I didn't mean to

684
00:23:47,266 --> 00:23:47,866
Ah

685
00:23:47,866 --> 00:23:49,533
It's not intentional, is it?

686
00:23:51,266 --> 00:23:52,266
You dare to push me

687
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:53,733
I didn't mean to

688
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:55,733
You wait for me

689
00:23:56,733 --> 00:23:57,466
Uncle

690
00:23:57,466 --> 00:23:58,600
I was bullied

691
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,866
He also pushed me

692
00:23:59,866 --> 00:24:01,800
My parents have never done anything to me

693
00:24:01,866 --> 00:24:03,333
Who is so bold

694
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:04,200
How dare I bully you

695
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,866
It's Luo Wei from our college

696
00:24:06,466 --> 00:24:08,000
It was me he bullied me

697
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,933
Uncle will definitely help you get justice

698
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:12,266
Thank you, uncle

699
00:24:12,266 --> 00:24:14,066
I know that you love Huanhuan the most

700
00:24:17,133 --> 00:24:18,933
Luo Wei You wait for me

701
00:24:19,133 --> 00:24:20,666
Bully Miss Ben

702
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,266
It will definitely make you look good

703
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:28,333
You want to fire me

704
00:24:29,066 --> 00:24:30,333
He was not convinced

705
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:31,800
Even if you have good academic performance

706
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,000
What can be done?

707
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,133
Your BL classmate's business

708
00:24:34,133 --> 00:24:35,866
It seriously affects the reputation of the college

709
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,866
I serve as the Director of Instruction

710
00:24:38,133 --> 00:24:40,066
You have the right to fire a BL like this

711
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:41,333
Yes

712
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:42,466
Since it's you

713
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,133
First of all, there is no distinction between black and white

714
00:24:44,133 --> 00:24:45,533
Make black white

715
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,066
Then let's take a look

716
00:24:47,066 --> 00:24:48,933
Whoever fires whom first

717
00:24:48,933 --> 00:24:49,933
Yo

718
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,666
How dare you threaten me

719
00:24:57,266 --> 00:24:58,133
Luo Shao

720
00:24:58,133 --> 00:24:59,466
You finally contacted me

721
00:24:59,466 --> 00:25:01,000
When will I see you

722
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,466
Luo Shao

723
00:25:05,466 --> 00:25:06,733
You finally contacted me

724
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,266
When will I see you

725
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:09,733
Just now

726
00:25:09,866 --> 00:25:10,733
I'm here

727
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,400
Office of the Director of Instruction

728
00:25:12,866 --> 00:25:13,400
Come here

729
00:25:13,466 --> 00:25:15,066
My people will be there soon

730
00:25:15,533 --> 00:25:17,600
Please start your performance

731
00:25:19,466 --> 00:25:21,533
Didn't you hear Lao Tzu educating students?

732
00:25:21,533 --> 00:25:23,800
Dare to bully my precious niece

733
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,600
Even if the king of heaven is coming

734
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,000
I will definitely fire you

735
00:25:28,733 --> 00:25:29,333
Principal

736
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:31,333
What wind blew you

737
00:25:31,466 --> 00:25:32,066
Master Luo

738
00:25:32,066 --> 00:25:32,866
Excuse me

739
00:25:32,866 --> 00:25:34,066
As soon as I received your call

740
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:35,600
Immediately put down the work in hand

741
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,533
Just came over

742
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,466
It's not late

743
00:25:37,866 --> 00:25:38,733
Principal

744
00:25:39,266 --> 00:25:40,400
You're late

745
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,400
5 minutes ago

746
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,666
I was expelled from school

747
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:43,600
What

748
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,666
Who dares to fire you

749
00:25:44,666 --> 00:25:45,600
I abandoned him

750
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,200
Oops

751
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,266
Who else could it be?

752
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,000
Of course, it manages our students

753
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,800
Teaching director

754
00:25:50,533 --> 00:25:51,066
you

755
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,666
Pack up your things immediately and get out

756
00:25:54,266 --> 00:25:55,066
Principal

757
00:25:55,066 --> 00:25:56,133
I know I was wrong

758
00:25:56,133 --> 00:25:58,266
Just spare me this time."

759
00:25:58,333 --> 00:25:59,866
It's not me who makes you angry

760
00:25:59,866 --> 00:26:01,066
It's Master Luo

761
00:26:01,066 --> 00:26:01,600
Luo classmates

762
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,733
No, young master

763
00:26:02,733 --> 00:26:03,733
I was confused for a moment

764
00:26:03,733 --> 00:26:05,066
You have a large number of adults

765
00:26:05,066 --> 00:26:06,800
Don't let the school expel me

766
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:09,000
You rely on yourself as the director of instruction

767
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,600

770
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,266
Have you ever thought about today's results?

771
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,866
If I had known, why should I have done it today?

772
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,133
It's all you ZY YD

773
00:26:21,933 --> 00:26:22,800
Master Luo

774
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,533
Our school education investment

775
00:26:25,866 --> 00:26:26,866
The principal can rest assured

776
00:26:26,933 --> 00:26:28,466
I'll ask the housekeeper to contact you

777
00:26:29,266 --> 00:26:30,333
You walk slowly

778
00:26:33,533 --> 00:26:34,333
Yo

779
00:26:34,733 --> 00:26:36,666
Isn't this Luo Dashao?

780
00:26:36,666 --> 00:26:38,533
It is actually condescending to be noble

781
00:26:38,533 --> 00:26:40,066
Come to the cafeteria for dinner

782
00:26:40,066 --> 00:26:41,466
Where do I go to eat?"

783
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:42,666
It seems unnecessary

784
00:26:42,666 --> 00:26:43,733
Report it to a dog

785
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:48,000
It's okay if you don't want to pay attention to me

786
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:51,000
I'm waiting to see Luo Shao who is booming NB

Dare to move Yang Huan

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,333
I let you have no place to bury yourself

792
00:27:04,533 --> 00:27:05,066
Hey

793
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,666
I will accompany you to visit the supermarket in the morning

794
00:27:07,666 --> 00:27:09,333
You are too energetic

795
00:27:09,533 --> 00:27:10,733
Okay, okay, let's go

796
00:27:10,866 --> 00:27:12,000
You buy these

797
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,666
I want to bring Rovi a breakfast

798
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,733

00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,333
What are you doing, Yang Huan

801
00:27:19,666 --> 00:27:20,733
You won't like it

802
00:27:20,733 --> 00:27:21,466
That stinky boy

803
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,200
Oh, okay, okay

804
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,000
Let's go

805
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,800
I didn't expect this to be famous

806
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,800
Female president Yang Le

809
00:27:29,266 --> 00:27:30,066
Hey

810
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,533
What did you say

811
00:27:31,866 --> 00:27:33,666
The Yang Group utilizes fake geonium ore

812
00:27:33,666 --> 00:27:34,533
FF JZ

813
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,466
No way

814
00:27:36,533 --> 00:27:38,400
This is all reported in the news

819
00:27:42,866 --> 00:27:44,200
It has entered the trial stage

820
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:47,600
Hey Yang Huan

821
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:49,466
Wake up Yang Huan

822
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,666
Yang Huan, you are awake

823
00:27:54,866 --> 00:27:56,066
Luo Wei

824
00:27:56,066 --> 00:27:57,266
How are you here

825
00:27:57,466 --> 00:27:58,933
Oh, it's a coincidence

826
00:27:59,066 --> 00:28:00,533
I happened to pass by a convenience store

827
00:28:00,533 --> 00:28:01,800
I saw you and Su Li

828
00:28:03,533 --> 00:28:04,666
The Yang family is going to do something big

829
00:28:04,666 --> 00:28:05,466
I want to hurry back."

830
00:28:05,533 --> 00:28:06,200
Calm down

831
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,600
You need to rest now

832
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,600
The giranite was given to me by you

833
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,866
I let you before that

834
00:28:15,866 --> 00:28:17,400
Apologize for doing my boyfriend's business

835
00:28:17,866 --> 00:28:21,000
But why are you?

836
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,733
I'm going back

837
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,133
You step aside

838
00:28:24,733 --> 00:28:26,400
Yang Huan, listen to my explanation

839
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,666
Not what you think

840
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:28,666
rest assured

841
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:30,800
I will definitely find out the truth of the matter

842
00:28:31,266 --> 00:28:33,266
It will definitely not let the Yang family be in trouble

843
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:37,200
Yesterday, Yang's Group was released

844
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,400
Because of the use of fake geollium ore FF JZ
 The Yang Group utilizes fake kernium ore FF JZ
 The current package has entered the trial stage

845
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,133
Sued by a large number of investors
 The Yang Group utilizes fake kernium ore FF JZ
 The current package has entered the trial stage

846
00:28:41,133 --> 00:28:42,600
It has now entered the trial stage
 The Yang Group utilizes fake kernium ore FF JZ
 The current package has entered the trial stage

847
00:28:43,466 --> 00:28:46,200
The gibronium I gave you cannot be fake

848
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,733
No one dares to sell our family fakes

849
00:28:49,866 --> 00:28:52,600
I'll investigate now

850
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,733
I already know who did it

851
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,800
It's the young master

852
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,133
Whoever it is

853
00:29:00,266 --> 00:29:03,800
I will definitely let him die without a place to be buried."

854
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,133
Miss Yang

855
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:11,866
Aren't you usually very arrogant?"

856
00:29:12,066 --> 00:29:13,933
Always looked down on me

857
00:29:14,533 --> 00:29:15,866
Now you have to be obedient

858
00:29:15,866 --> 00:29:17,933
Kneel down in front of me

859
00:29:21,533 --> 00:29:22,733
As long as Miss Yang

860
00:29:22,733 --> 00:29:23,933
Coaxed me to be happy

861
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:25,933
This chisel

862
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,666
I would like 50 million

863
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:29,333
Sell it to your Yang family at a low price

864
00:29:30,266 --> 00:29:31,933
But it's okay if you don't want to

865
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,133
After all, your Yang family

866
00:29:34,133 --> 00:29:36,733
And it's not just your daughter

867
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:39,133
I've liked your sister Yang Huan for a long time

868
00:29:41,533 --> 00:29:42,066
No

869
00:29:43,266 --> 00:29:44,200
Please let Huan Huan go

870
00:29:46,866 --> 00:29:48,333
I'll do what you say

871
00:29:55,466 --> 00:29:56,266
You rebellious son

872
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,533
Who the hell have you offended

873
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,800
Dad, why are you here?"

874
00:30:00,266 --> 00:30:00,800
Fast

875
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,933
Give Luo a little compensation

876
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:04,400
I have long said don't touch the Yang family

877
00:30:05,533 --> 00:30:06,466
Right now

878
00:30:06,466 --> 00:30:08,866
Ready to take on my fury

879
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,200
Luo Wei, don't be impulsive

880
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,600
I will return the rongium to the Yang family now."

881
00:30:11,666 --> 00:30:12,533
It's late

882
00:30:12,533 --> 00:30:14,066
After today

883
00:30:14,266 --> 00:30:16,866
I want the Tang family to disappear in Binshi

884
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,000
It's all our fault

885
00:30:21,066 --> 00:30:22,866
Please let us live

886
00:30:22,866 --> 00:30:23,800
I want to admit my mistake

887
00:30:23,866 --> 00:30:24,800
Yes

888
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:27,200
Go kneel down and kowtow to Yang Le

889
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,933
Knocked to Yang Le

890
00:30:27,933 --> 00:30:29,400
I am willing to let you go

891
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,933
This matter can't be left alone

892
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,933
I want to make Luo Wei pay for his blood

893
00:30:38,133 --> 00:30:39,200
useless

894
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,466
The strength behind them is too great

895
00:30:41,533 --> 00:30:42,600
We have no chance of winning

896
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,800
Is this the Tang family?

897
00:30:45,066 --> 00:30:46,000
It's really too many comfortable days

898
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,200
It's really too comfortable

899
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,800
There is no blood at all

900
00:30:48,933 --> 00:30:50,266
Where did the nameless junior come from

901
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:52,000
also dare to teach our Tang family a lesson

902
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,800
Tang Wei

903
00:30:53,733 --> 00:30:55,133

904
00:30:55,133 --> 00:30:57,400
Help you establish the Tang family

905
00:30:57,866 --> 00:30:58,933
This is

00:30:58,933 --> 00:31:00,333
It doesn't matter who I am

907
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:03,066
I want to ruin Luo Wei's reputation

908
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:05,533
And do as I command

909
00:31:07,066 --> 00:31:08,400
Our Tang family is up and down

910
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,000
I would like to listen to your arrangements

00:31:10,133 --> 00:31:14,000
Brother Yang

912
00:31:14,066 --> 00:31:16,466
In the final analysis, I have no way to discipline them

913
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,333
Drunkenness and promiscuity

914
00:31:19,933 --> 00:31:22,066
I brought him here today

915
00:31:22,066 --> 00:31:22,933
I apologize to you

916
00:31:23,066 --> 00:31:23,866
I'm sorry Uncle Yang

I'm here to make amends for your sister

924
00:31:34,266 --> 00:31:35,400
No, you don't

925
00:31:37,066 --> 00:31:38,266
Keep saying

926
00:31:38,266 --> 00:31:39,933
Come and apologize to my sister

927
00:31:39,933 --> 00:31:41,800
But he only brought a blue and white porcelain

928
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,333

955
00:32:54,466 --> 00:32:56,533
I know you're still angry with me

956
00:32:57,133 --> 00:32:59,066
I don't ask you to forgive me

957
00:32:59,133 --> 00:33:00,866
But we're still friends, right?

958
00:33:05,466 --> 00:33:06,600
Am I good-looking?

959
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:13,266
I just broke someone else's bottle of wine

960
00:33:13,333 --> 00:33:14,466
People asked me to compensate

961
00:33:14,466 --> 00:33:16,200
But I don't have that much money

962
00:33:16,533 --> 00:33:18,066
Can you help me?"

963
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:22,333
30,008

964
00:33:23,933 --> 00:33:26,666
You feel like yourself
 Is it worth the price?

965
00:33:26,866 --> 00:33:28,533
I don't want to see you again

966
00:33:28,533 --> 00:33:29,933
What do you mean

967
00:33:29,933 --> 00:33:33,733
But you have to give it if you don't give it today

968
00:33:34,066 --> 00:33:35,066
Otherwise

969
00:33:35,066 --> 00:33:37,400
I'll call the police now
 Say you forced me

970
00:33:38,133 --> 00:33:39,800
Played all night

971
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,200
Just for this

972
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:47,533
How did it work?

973
00:33:48,066 --> 00:33:48,733
It's done

974
00:33:48,733 --> 00:33:53,333
I looked at Luo Wei with my own eyes
 was taken away

975
00:33:53,733 --> 00:33:55,666
Even if I can't kill you this time

976
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,733
I have to make you suffer a little too

977
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,600
Luo Shao I'm really sorry

978
00:34:02,866 --> 00:34:05,266
How is it possible to force one
 Cheap bar marketing

979
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:06,133
Never mind

980
00:34:06,133 --> 00:34:07,933
As long as I can prove my innocence

981
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,266
I don't want to

982
00:34:09,266 --> 00:34:10,933
Let our family be jealous

983
00:34:11,866 --> 00:34:12,666
After investigation

984
00:34:12,666 --> 00:34:14,933
The biggest suspicion
 It should be Jiang Qingqing

985
00:34:15,133 --> 00:34:17,600
But she shouldn't
 The mastermind behind the scenes

986
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,733
Isn't this Master Luo?"

987
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,600
Why did you commit a crime?

988
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,466
It's the first time I've seen you
 Someone took the initiative to send it to the door

989
00:34:26,266 --> 00:34:28,200
Ms. Jiang Qingqing and Mr. Tang Chuan

990
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,466
Now we doubt you two
 Suspected WG FB

991
00:34:31,466 --> 00:34:32,733
Please cooperate with our investigation

992
00:34:32,733 --> 00:34:33,533
Come with us

993
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:41,866
OM

994
00:34:47,133 --> 00:34:47,866
Hey

995
00:34:47,866 --> 00:34:48,733
Luo Shao

996
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,933
It's been a long time since I last saw you

997
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,466
Tang Chuan

998
00:34:52,466 --> 00:34:54,466
How is Huanhuan's mobile phone here?

999
00:34:54,466 --> 00:34:56,000
You are looking for Huanhuan

1000
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,000
She's at my house

1001
00:34:58,466 --> 00:34:59,933
But it's a pity

1002
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:02,933
Huanhuan will fall asleep here

1003
00:35:03,266 --> 00:35:05,866
Luo Shao wants to pick up people in person

1004
00:35:05,866 --> 00:35:07,066
Tang Chuan, I warn you

1005
00:35:07,066 --> 00:35:08,933
If you dare to move a hair

1006
00:35:08,933 --> 00:35:10,666
I will let your entire Tang family be buried

1007
00:35:10,666 --> 00:35:11,666
Luo Wei

1008
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:14,400
You have done good things to me again and again

1009
00:35:14,466 --> 00:35:16,333
I'm going to make you pay

1010
00:35:16,533 --> 00:35:18,200
Today the Yang family and you

1011
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,400
Don't run away from anyone

1012
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,266
Tang Chuan

1013
00:35:24,266 --> 00:35:25,133
You let her go

1014
00:35:25,133 --> 00:35:26,466
You can do as much as you want

1015
00:35:27,533 --> 00:35:28,466
Luo Wei

1016
00:35:28,466 --> 00:35:31,333
I just wanted to get the Yang family

1017
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:32,533
But now

1018
00:35:32,533 --> 00:35:34,266
I changed my mind

1019
00:35:34,266 --> 00:35:36,266
Aren't you crazy

1020
00:35:36,266 --> 00:35:37,533
Don't touch her

1021
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,933
I am just for you

1022
00:35:39,933 --> 00:35:42,666
Watching his woman be WN

1023
00:35:42,866 --> 00:35:43,733
Hmph

1024
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,466
Let her go

1025
00:35:50,266 --> 00:35:51,000
Luo Wei

1026
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,733
You also have today

1027
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:53,800
Hahaha

1028
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,200
Looking for death

1029
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,000
Joy

1030
00:36:04,666 --> 00:36:06,600
Let me go

1031
00:36:07,933 --> 00:36:08,533
BIRTH

1032
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:10,866
BIRTH

1033
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,200
Young master

1034
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:13,600
How did you find this?

1035
00:36:13,666 --> 00:36:15,133
I still remember it in the young master's hand

1036
00:36:15,133 --> 00:36:16,266
Is it a pitch black dragon king card?

1037
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,866
There are special chips in it

1038
00:36:17,866 --> 00:36:19,466
It can be positioned by satellite

1039
00:36:19,666 --> 00:36:21,600
What should the young master do?

1040
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,666
Leave it to the inspection

1041
00:36:27,466 --> 00:36:28,533
It seems

1042
00:36:28,533 --> 00:36:31,466
The Tang family is really useless
